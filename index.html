      Alone in the woods<br>
      You hear something behind you<br>
      Ghost Big Ten Mascots<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our newest game, Ghosts of Bowl Games Past, pits our main character Zeke the Wonder Dog against the ghosts of every mascot in the Big Ten Conference. The main goal of the game is to gather as many anti-ghost frisbees as possible in order to send the ghost mascots back to the shadow realm. When you win our new game, this sound will play.
